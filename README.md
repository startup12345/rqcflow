Fetch water levels and river flows for the province of Quebec from
[Centre d'Expertise Hydrique du Québec (CEHQ)](https://www.cehq.gouv.qc.ca).
CEHQ is part of the *Ministère de l'Environnement
et de la Lutte contre les changements climatiques* (in English, Ministry of
Environment and Fight Against Climate Change).

## Installation

The package is still at an early development stage. Best is to not install it
for now. Stay tuned!

## Disclaimer

The authors are not affiliated to CEHQ in any way. We just want to ease
hydrologic data fetching and processing operations.
